# Trueshot Backend

This is the backend service for **Trueshot**, a social media pet project inspired by BeReal, but with our own experimental additions and ideas.

> 🚧 This project is a personal learning experiment and was largely implemented with the assistance of AI tools. As such, the code quality may not be optimal and could contain bugs or security vulnerabilities.

## 🚀 What is Trueshot?

Trueshot is a minimal social media concept where users share authentic moments of their day. Similar to BeReal, it encourages genuine photo sharing, but we’ve added our own twists and features to differentiate it.

This repo contains the backend side of the project, written with a focus on practicing the **Vipe Coding** approach:

It may not follow all best practices strictly, but it serves as a solid exploration into modular backend structure and architecture.
